# StudentsInSync

Through the utilization of Nextcloud, "Students In Sync" aims to compile data from multiple cloud platforms into one aggregate service. This project would utilize platforms most commonly used by students such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, and iCloud. Because of the lack of syncing capabilities between iCloud and Dropbox, a student who owns both an iPad and a Microsoft computer would likely go through a tedious process to share files between the two devices. "Students In Sync" creates one cohesive tool for students to access all necessary documents.‚Äù
